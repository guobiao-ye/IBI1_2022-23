In practical 4 I learned how to use git command to set up a working branch and make changes to the branch content on the local computer. I also learned how to use gitHub and set up a static web page on it.

In the process of git practice, I think it is difficult to make clear the relationship between Working directory, local Repository and remote repository.

In the process of building web pages, I think the more difficult is how to input instructions to get the style of the web page.
